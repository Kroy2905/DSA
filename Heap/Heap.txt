A binary heap is a Binary tree with following properties 
- A binary heap is either min heap or max heap . In a min Heap the key at root must be minimum among
all keys present in Biary heap. The same property must be recursively true for all nodes in Binary heap 
- Its a complete binary tree (all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys
as left as possible).This property makes heap suitable to be stored in an array

                                                /    \
                                            10        20   <-- min heap 
                                            / \      /  \

Why we need Binary heap ? - To find the maximum and minimum number among a set of numbers in O(logn) time
and also make sure that inserting additional numbers does not take more then O (logn) time 
Practical use - Prim's Algorithm , Heap sort and Priority Queue 

There are 2 types of Heap 
Min heap -  the value of each node is less than its children 

                                                   5
                                                /    \
                                            10        20   <-- min heap 
                                            / \      /  \
                                          30   40   50   60
                                          /\
                                         70 80          

Max heap - the vakue of each node is greatehr than its children 

                                                  80
                                                /    \
                                            70        60   <-- min heap 
                                            / \      /  \
                                          50   40   30   20
                                          /\
                                         5  10          

Operations in Binary heap : 
- Creation of Binary heap 
- pekk top of Binary Heap
- Extract min / max 
- traversal of Binary Heap
- Size of Binary Heap
- Insert value in Binary Heap
- Delete in Binary Heap 

Implementation - 1) Pointer 2 ) Array 
Array implementation 
left child = 2 * index 
right child = 2 * index + 1 

Extaction in heap can be done only for the root , when the root is extracted , and the tree 
loses the heap property , then we need to heapify top to bottom
