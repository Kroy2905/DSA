Sorting is simply arranging data in ascending or descending order. 
 
 Tupes of sorting 
 1 - Space Used - 
 i) inplace - Does not require extra space - buule sort 
 
 ii) out of place  - requires extra space - merge sort 

 2 - Stability -
  i)stable  - The order of similar data is not changed post sorting - insertion sort 
  ii) unstable - The order of similar data is changed - quick sort 
  Terminology - 
  Increasing order - If successive element is greater than the previous element
  Decreasing order - If successive element is less than the previous element
  Non Increasing order - If successive element is less than or equal to the previous element
  Non Decreasing order - If successive element is greater than or equal to the previous element

  Different types of sorting : 
  1) Bubble sort - We repeatedly compar each pair of adjacent elements and swap them if they are in wrong order. 
  T(n) -> O(n^2) , S(n) -> O(1)
  When to use - i) elements are almost sorted , 2) space is a concern
  When to avoid - i)elements are large in number 

  2) Selection sort - Find the minimum element and move it to the sorted part of the array to make the unsorted part sorted 
  
T(n) -> O(n^2) , S(n) -> O(1)
  When to use - i) when we have less memory 
  When to avoid - i) time is important 

  3) Insertion sort - Divide the array into two parts . Take first element from the unsorted part of the array and move
  to its appropriate position in the sorted array . Repeat until unsorted array is empty 

  T(n) -> O(n^2) , S(n) -> O(1)
  When to use - i) when we have less memory ii) there is continuous flow of elements 
  When to avoid - i) time is important 

  4) Bucket sort : i) We create buckets and distribute elemnents into buckets  , creation of buckets depends 
  on an ideal function which in turn is dependent on the number of elements ii) sort each bucket iii)merge the 
  buckets to get a sorted list of elements.

  T(n) -> O(n log n) , S(n) -> O(n)
  When to use - i) when the elemnts are uniformly distributed . e.g. - 1,2,3,5,6,4,9  , dont use e.g- 100,2,3001.20
  When to avoid - i) space is important
