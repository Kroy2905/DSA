The **Bellman-Ford algorithm** is an algorithm for finding the **shortest paths** from a single 
source vertex to all other vertices in a **weighted graph**. It can handle
 **negative weight edges**, which makes it more versatile than Dijkstra's algorithm.
  However, it is generally less efficient than Dijkstra's for graphs without negative weights.

### Key Characteristics of Bellman-Ford:
- **Handles Negative Weights**: Unlike Dijkstra’s algorithm, Bellman-Ford can find
 shortest paths even when some edges have negative weights. 
 IMPORTANT ----- However, the presence of **negative  weight cycles** (cycles where the
  total sum of edge weights is negative) makes finding shortest paths impossible.
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(V X E) , where \(V\) is the number of
 vertices and \(E\) is the number of edges, making it suitable for smaller graphs or graphs with 
 negative weights.
- **Can Detect Negative Cycles**: The algorithm can also detect if there is a **negative weight
 cycle** reachable from the source, which is useful for checking if a problem has no feasible solution.

### How the Bellman-Ford Algorithm Works:
The algorithm iteratively relaxes edges, trying to update the shortest path estimates for all vertices.

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set the **distance** of the source vertex to `0`.
   - Set the **distance** of all other vertices to **infinity** (`∞`), as they are 
   initially unreachable from the source.
   
2. **Relaxation**:
   - Repeat the following **(V - 1)** times (where `V` is the number of vertices):
     - For each edge `(u, v)` with weight `w` in the graph:
       - If the distance to `u` plus the weight of the edge `w` is less than the distance 
       to `v` (`dist[u] + w < dist[v]`):
         - Update the distance to `v` as `dist[v] = dist[u] + w`.
         - Update the predecessor or parent of `v` to `u` (optional, for path reconstruction).
   - This ensures that the shortest path with at most \(V - 1\) edges is found.

3. **Negative Cycle Check**:
   - After the \(V - 1\) iterations, go through each edge `(u, v)` one more time:
     - If we find any edge where `dist[u] + w < dist[v]`, it indicates the presence of 
     a **negative weight cycle** because it means that we can still find a shorter path.
   - If a negative cycle is detected, the algorithm can report it, and the shortest paths 
   cannot be determined.

### Example of Bellman-Ford:
Let’s consider a simple graph with 4 vertices (0, 1, 2, 3) and 5 edges:
- Edge (0, 1) with weight `5`
- Edge (0, 2) with weight `4`
- Edge (1, 3) with weight `3`
- Edge (2, 1) with weight `6`
- Edge (3, 2) with weight `-2`

Let's find the shortest paths from the source node `0`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `dist[0] = 0` (Source node distance is `0`)
   - `dist[1] = ∞`, `dist[2] = ∞`, `dist[3] = ∞` (All other distances are set to infinity)

2. **First Iteration** (Relax all edges):
   - `(0, 1, 5)`: `dist[0] + 5 < ∞` → `dist[1] = 5`
   - `(0, 2, 4)`: `dist[0] + 4 < ∞` → `dist[2] = 4`
   - `(1, 3, 3)`: `dist[1] + 3 < ∞` → `dist[3] = 8`
   - `(2, 1, 6)`: `dist[2] + 6 < 5` → `dist[1]` remains `5`
   - `(3, 2, -2)`: `dist[3] - 2 < 4` → `dist[2] = 6`

3. **Second and Third Iterations** (Repeat relaxation):
   - Further relaxations will not change the distances since the shortest paths have
    already been determined.

4. **Negative Cycle Check**:
   - Check each edge to see if `dist[u] + w < dist[v]` holds true. If it does for any 
   edge, a negative cycle exists. Here, there is no such condition, so no negative cycle is detected.

### Result:
- The shortest distances from node `0` are:
  - `dist[0] = 0`
  - `dist[1] = 5`
  - `dist[2] = 4`
  - `dist[3] = 8`

### Summary:
- **Algorithm**: Iteratively relaxes edges to find the shortest path, repeating for \(V - 1\) times.
- **Use Cases**: Best for graphs with negative edge weights and for detecting negative weight cycles.
- **Complexity**: \(O(V \times E)\), making it slower than Dijkstra’s algorithm for large graphs 
without negative weights.
- **Output**: Shortest distances from a source vertex and detection of negative weight 
cycles if they exist.
