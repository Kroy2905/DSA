Linklist is a form of sequential collection and it does not have to be in order . 
A linked list is made up of independent nodes that may contain any type of data and each 
node has a reference to the next node in the link.
-- A link lost is not contiguous in memory
e.g. - nodes are compartments of train 
A link list has a head and a tail 
the physical location of the next node is stored in the pointer of the previous note 

Arrays vs LinkedList 
- variable length or size 
- single elements / node can exist on its own 
- LinkedList is used for insertion and deletion optimisation whereas Array is used  for accessing 

Types of LinkedList :
1- Single LinkedList ,2 Circular-LinkedList ,3-Doubly LinkedList, 4-Circular Doubly LinkedList

Single LinkedList : [0,001]->[1,111]->[2,222]->[3,null]         
                     ^          ^         ^         ^
                     |          |         |         |
     head[0,000]    000        001       111        222         tail [3,222]  
    Head points to the starting node , tail points to the last node , head  and tail are just pointers 
    and not part of the LinkedList, they are just used  for indication 

Circular Single LinkedList - Its similar to single linked list where the  last node address is not null but 
points to the first node / head 
e.g.- giving opportunity to each ludo player ,  when we reach to last player  next it  should point to first player 

Doubly LinkedList :     [null,0,001]<->[000,1,111]<->[001,2,222]<->[111,3,null]         
                             ^                ^         ^             ^
                             |                |         |             |
 head[0,000]                 000             001       111            222      tail [3,222] 
 e.g.  - used in music app 

 Circular Doubly Linked List - its a Doubly LinkedList where the previous  reference of 1st node is the
 last node and last node's next reference is 1st node
 e.g. - check recent apps in mobile 

 How LinkedList are stored in memory : 
 They are not located contiguously . Memory allocation is random 

 Creation of Single LinkedList : 
 1- create a blank head and tail pointer
 2- create a node 
 3- point head to the 1st node and the tail to the last node
